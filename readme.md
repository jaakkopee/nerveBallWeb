Nerve wrecking, ball splitting action!

Nerve Ball -- "Do my balls get on your nerves?"

An addicting ballgame with a neural network guiding system modulating the trajectories of the balls.
- click on balls to divide them to smaller balls.
- the smaller the ball, the bigger the score.
- the smallest ball does not divide, but disappears and player gains one minute play time.
- the game ends when the time runs out or the balls all disappear.
- the faster the ball, the bigger the score.
- misses cause a time penalty.
